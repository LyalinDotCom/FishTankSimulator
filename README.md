## ✨ Features

- **🐠 Real-time 3D Environment**: A beautiful and dynamic fishtank rendered in real-time using Three.js.
- **🐟 Procedural Animation**: A configurable number of fish swim with natural, procedurally generated patterns.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Fish Generation**: Generate unique, new fish on the fly using the power of Google's Gemini model via Genkit.
- **📸 Custom Fish from Camera**: Use your device's camera to snap a picture and instantly turn it into a fish in the tank.
- **🖼️ Custom Fish from Upload**: Upload any image from your device to create a custom fish.
- **🔄 Interactive Controls**: Easily reset the simulation, change the number of fish, and manage your aquatic world.

## 🛠️ How It's Built

AquaVida is a modern web application that demonstrates the integration of real-time 3D graphics and generative AI. It was built inside **Firebase Studio**.

The core technologies used are:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: A cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **[Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)**: An open-source framework from Google that helps you build, deploy, and monitor production-ready AI flows.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Used for hosting the application.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Running Locally

To get AquaVida running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or later) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: You'll need Git to clone the repository.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The AI-powered fish generation feature uses the Google Gemini API. To use it, you need to provide an API key.

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add your Google AI API key to the file. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

```
# .env.local
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
```

> **Note**: Without this key, the core application will still run, but the "Generate AI Fish" feature will fail.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

This project requires two separate development servers to be running at the same time:

1.  **The Next.js Frontend Server**: This serves the main application.
2.  **The Genkit AI Server**: This runs the AI flows that the application calls.

-   **To start the Next.js server**, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

-   **To start the Genkit server**, open a **second terminal window** and run:

    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

    This will start the Genkit development server, allowing the frontend to communicate with your AI flows.

You should now have the full AquaVida experience running locally!
