# **App Name**: AquaVida

## Core Features:

- 3D Environment Rendering: Rendering the 3D environment for the fish tank using ThreeJS. This includes the tank, background, and lighting.
- Fish Animation: Creating and animating realistic-looking fish models with natural swimming patterns.
- Water Effects: Implementing water shader effects to simulate realistic water appearance and movement.
- Plant Animation: Adding animated 3D plants with swaying and gentle movement in the current.
- Camera Controls: Implementing user controls to adjust camera angles and zoom levels for better viewing.
- Procedural swimming patterns: Use of a generative AI tool to create diverse and realistic animations of the fish. Fish movements and group interactions could vary to add realism. If there's not enough space to swim around, the fish shouldn't try to swim over there.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#A7D9ED) to simulate clear, clean water.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, for a clean, bright environment.
- Accent color: Green (#90EE90) for the plants, creating a natural contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clear, modern UI elements.
- Simple, outlined icons for interactive elements like settings or info buttons.
- Gentle swaying animations for plants and smooth, fluid animations for fish movements.
